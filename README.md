# Branch deprecated

This branch is what remains of my attempts to use go web assembly for my frontend.  In the end, it was faster and easier to switch to javascript or typescript.

I intend to do a writeup on the lessons I learned, but in a nutshell, the client API calls to the server would not attach data properly.  

If you read through this and can figure out why, please do not hesitate to contact me.
